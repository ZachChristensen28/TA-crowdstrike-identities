# Roadmap

## Pull only updated identities

[GitHub Feature Request #2 <small>:icon-link-external:</small>](https://github.com/ZachChristensen28/TA-crowdstrike-identities/issues/2){ target="blank" }

This add-on currently pulls every identity on each run interval. Future updates will look to only pull in updated identities after the initial pull.
